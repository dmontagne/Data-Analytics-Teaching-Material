# Data-Analytics-Teaching-Material

This repository contains code and slides for teaching a intro level course on Data Analytics for Business at Duke University. 
The material is written to be general for multiple use in similar contexts with little reformating. Most of the course is written with examples using the Survey of Consumer Finances.
